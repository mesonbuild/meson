# Added c17 and c18 as c_std values for recent GCC and Clang Versions

For gcc version 8.0 and later, the values 'c17', 'c18', 'gnu17', and 'gnu18' were added to the accepted values for built-in compiler option c_std.

For Clang version 10.0 and later on Apple OSX (Darwin), and for version 7.0 and later on other platforms, the values 'c17' and 'gnu17' were added as c_std values.
