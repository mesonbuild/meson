## Script environment variables

`host_machine` and `target_machine`. For cross compilation they are
set in the cross file.

Any cpu family not listed in the above list is not guaranteed to
remain stable in future releases.

Those porting from autotools should note that Meson does not add
endianness to the name of the cpu_family. For example, autotools
will call little endian PPC64 "ppc64le", Meson will not, you must
also check the `.endian()` value of the machine for this information.

## Operating system names

These are provided by the `.system()` method call.

| Value               | Comment                         |
| -----               | -------                         |

Any string not listed above is not guaranteed to remain stable in
future releases.

## Kernel names (since 1.2.0)

Native names as returned by the `.kernel()` method.

## Subsystem names (since 1.2.0)

A more specific description of the system in question. Most values are
meant to be used in cross files only, as those platforms can not run
Meson natively.

## Language arguments parameter names

These are the parameter names for passing language specific arguments
to your build target.

| MASM          | masm_args      | N/A               |
| Linear ASM    | linearasm_args | N/A               |

All these `<lang>_*` options are specified per machine. See in
[specifying options per
machine](Builtin-options.md#Specifying-options-per-machine) for on how
to do this in cross builds.

## Compiler and linker flag environment variables

These environment variables will be used to modify the compiler and
linker flags.

It is recommended that you **do not use these**. They are provided
purely to for backwards compatibility with other build systems. There
are many caveats to their use, especially when rebuilding the project.
It is **highly** recommended that you use [the command line
arguments](#language-arguments-parameter-names) instead.

| Name        | Comment                                  |
| -----       | -------                                  |
| CFLAGS      | Flags for the C compiler                 |
| CXXFLAGS    | Flags for the C++ compiler               |
| CUFLAGS     | Flags for the CUDA compiler              |
| OBJCFLAGS   | Flags for the Objective C compiler       |
| FFLAGS      | Flags for the Fortran compiler           |
| DFLAGS      | Flags for the D compiler                 |
| VALAFLAGS   | Flags for the Vala compiler              |
| RUSTFLAGS   | Flags for the Rust compiler              |
| CYTHONFLAGS | Flags for the Cython compiler            |
| LDFLAGS     | The linker flags, used for all languages |

N.B. these settings are specified per machine, and so the environment
variables actually come in pairs. See the [environment variables per
machine](#Environment-variables-per-machine) section for details.

## Function Attributes

These are the parameters names that are supported using
`compiler.has_function_attribute()` or
`compiler.get_supported_function_attributes()`

### GCC `__attribute__`

These values are supported using the GCC style `__attribute__` annotations,
which are supported by GCC, Clang, and other compilers.

\* *Changed in 0.52.0* the "visibility" target no longer includes
"protected", which is not present in Apple's clang.

† *New in 0.52.0* These split visibility attributes are preferred to the plain
"visibility" as they provide narrower checks.

⁶ *New in 1.1.0*

⁷ *New in 1.5.0*

## Dependency lookup methods

These are the values that can be passed to `dependency` function's
`method` keyword argument.

## Compiler and Linker selection variables

N.B. these settings are specified per machine, and so the environment
variables actually come in pairs. See the [environment variables per
machine](#Environment-variables-per-machine) section for details.

*The old environment variables are still supported, but are deprecated
and will be removed in a future version of Meson.

*changed in 1.3.0* Paths with spaces were split unconditionally to extract
components such as the [path to Ccache](Feature-autodetection.md#ccache),
intrinsic compiler flags like `-m32` or `--target`, etc. This broke passing
a hardcoded compiler path to CMake subprojects. To work around this, paths
must be wrapped with double quotes:

```bash
export CC='"C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.34.31933/bin/Hostx64/x64/cl.exe"'
```

You can also set the values through [machine files](Machine-files.md#binaries).

*New in 1.3.0* Paths that point to an existing executable no longer need
wrapping:

```bash
export CC='C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.34.31933/bin/Hostx64/x64/cl.exe'
```


## Environment variables per machine

Since *0.54.0*, Following Autotool and other legacy build systems,
environment variables that affect machine-specific settings come in
pairs: for every bare environment variable `FOO`, there is a suffixed
`FOO_FOR_BUILD`, where `FOO` just affects the host machine
configuration, while `FOO_FOR_BUILD` just affects the build machine
configuration. For example:

 - `PKG_CONFIG_PATH_FOR_BUILD` controls the paths pkg-config will search for
   just `native: true` dependencies (build machine).

 - `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` controls the paths pkg-config will search for just
   `native: false` dependencies (host machine).

This mirrors the `build.` prefix used for (built-in) Meson options,
which has the same meaning.

This is useful for cross builds. In the native builds, build = host,
and the unsuffixed environment variables alone will suffice.

Prior to *0.54.0*, there was no `_FOR_BUILD`-suffixed variables, and
most environment variables only effected native machine
configurations, though this wasn't consistent (e.g. `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
still affected cross builds).
