long_name: Compiler object
description: |
  This object is returned by [[meson.get_compiler]].
  It represents a compiler for a given language and allows you to query its properties.

notes:
- |
  These compiler checks do not use compiler arguments added
  with `add_*_arguments()`, via `-Dlang_args` on the command-line, or
  through `CFLAGS`/`LDFLAGS`, etc in the environment. Hence, you can
  trust that the tests will be fully self-contained, and won't fail
  because of custom flags added by other parts of the build file or by
  users.

- |
  Note that if you have a single prefix with all your dependencies, you
  might find it easier to append to the environment variables
  `C_INCLUDE_PATH` with GCC/Clang and `INCLUDE` with MSVC to expand the
  default include path, and `LIBRARY_PATH` with GCC/Clang and `LIB` with
  MSVC to expand the default library search path.

  However, with GCC, these variables will be ignored when
  cross-compiling. In that case you need to use a specs file. See:
  http://www.mingw.org/wiki/SpecsFileHOWTO

        If a string is passed, the code is used directly. If a [[@file]] object
        is passed, its content is used for the compiler check.

        Used to pass a list of compiler arguments.
        Defining include paths for headers not in the default include path
        via `-Isome/path/to/header` is generally supported, however, usually not
        recommended.

        This is because include directories can also be specified via the
        `include_directories` or the `dependency` kwarg (if present).
        The same is also true for passing libraries to link with `-lfoo`.

        separated by a newline.
        System definitions should be passed via compiler args
        (eg: `_GNU_SOURCE` is often required for some symbols to be exposed
