description: Opaque object representing an external program

methods:
- name: cmd_array
  returns: list[str]
  since: 1.2.0
  description: |
    Returns an array containing the arguments needed to run a program.

    **NOTE:** You should not usually need to use this method. Passing the
    object itself should work in most contexts where a program can appear,
    and allows Meson to setup inter-target dependencies correctly (for
    example in cases where a program might be overridden by a [[@build_tgt]]).
    Only use this if you specifically need a command array.

- name: found
  returns: bool
  description: Returns whether the executable was found.

- name: path
  returns: str
  deprecated: 0.55.0
  description: |
    *Deprecated:* Use [[external_program.full_path]] instead.

    Returns a string pointing to the script or executable.

    **NOTE:** You should not usually need to use this method. Passing the
    object itself should work in most contexts where a program can appear,
    and allows Meson to setup inter-target dependencies correctly (for
    example in cases where a program might be overridden by a [[@build_tgt]]).
    Only use this if you specifically need a string, such as when embedding
    a program path into a header file, or storing it into an environment
    variable.

    For example:

    ```meson
    run_command(find_program('foo'), 'arg1', 'arg2')
    ```

- name: version
  returns: str
  since: 0.62.0
  description: |
    The version number as a string, for example `1.2.8`.

    `unknown` if the program cannot determine the version via a `--version` argument.

- name: full_path
  returns: str
  since: 0.55.0
