    since: 0.47.0
    description: |
      Specify the file mode in symbolic format
      and optionally the owner/uid and group/gid for the installed files.

      See the `install_mode` kwarg of [[install_data]] for more information.

  install_dir:
    type: str
    description: Where to install to.

  install_tag:
    type: str
    since: 1.11.0
    description: |
      A string used by the `meson install --tags` command
      to install only a subset of the files. By default these files have `man` install
      tag which means they are installed explicitly or when no tags given at all

  locale:
    type: str
    since: 0.58.0
    description: |
      Can be used to specify the locale
      into which the
      man page will be installed within the manual page directory tree.
      An example manual might be `foo.fr.1` with a locale of `fr`, such
      that `{mandir}/{locale}/man{num}/foo.1` becomes the installed file.
