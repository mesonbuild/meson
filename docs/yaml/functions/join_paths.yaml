name: join_paths
returns: str
since: 0.36.0
description: |
  Joins the given strings into a file system path segment. For example
  `join_paths('foo', 'bar')` results in `foo/bar`. If any one of the
  individual segments is an absolute path, all segments before it are
  dropped. That means that `join_paths('foo', '/bar')` returns `/bar`.
  See also [[fs.join_absolute]].

  *(since 0.49.0)* Using the `/` operator on strings is equivalent to calling
  [[join_paths]].

  ```meson
  # res1 and res2 will have identical values
  res1 = join_paths(foo, bar)
  res2 = foo / bar
  ```

warnings:
  - Don't use [[join_paths]] for sources in [[library]] and [[executable]]. You should use [[files]] instead.
