name: build_target
returns: build_tgt
description: |
  Creates a build target whose type can be set dynamically with the
  `target_type` keyword argument.

  `target_type` may be set to one of:

  - `executable` (see [[executable]])
  - `shared_library` (see [[shared_library]])
  - `shared_module` (see [[shared_module]])
  - `static_library` (see [[static_library]])
  - `both_libraries` (see [[both_libraries]])
  - `library` (see [[library]])
  - `jar` (see [[jar]])*

  This declaration:

  ```meson
  executable(<arguments and keyword arguments>)
  ```

  is equivalent to this:

  ```meson
  build_target(<arguments and keyword arguments>, target_type : 'executable')
  ```

  The lists for the kwargs (such as `sources`, `objects`, and `dependencies`) are
  always flattened, which means you can freely nest and add lists while
  creating the final list.

  The returned object also has methods that are documented in [[@build_tgt]].

  *"jar" is deprecated because it is fundamentally a different thing than the
  other build_target types.
