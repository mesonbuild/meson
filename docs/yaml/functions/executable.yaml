name: executable
returns: exe
description: |
  Creates a new executable. The first argument specifies its name and
  the remaining positional arguments define the input files to use.

  The arrays for the kwargs (such as `sources`, `objects`, and `dependencies`) are
  always flattened, which means you can freely nest and add arrays while
  creating the final array.

  The returned object also has methods that are documented in [[@exe]].

  *Since 1.3.0* executable names can be the same across multiple targets as
  long as they each have a different `name_suffix`.

warnings:
  - The `link_language` kwarg was broken until 0.55.0

  android_exe_type:

    since: 1.8.0
    description: |
      Specifies the intended target of the executable. This can either be
      `executable`, if the intended usecase is to run the executable using
      fork + exec, or `application` if the executable is supposed to be
      loaded as shared object by the android runtime.


  export_dynamic:
    type: bool

    description: |
       when set to true causes the target's symbols to be
        dynamically exported, allowing modules built using the
        [[shared_module]] function to refer to functions,
        variables and other symbols defined in the executable itself. Implies
        the `implib` argument.

  implib:
    type: bool | str
    since: 0.42.0
    description: |
      When set to true, an import library is generated for the
      executable (the name of the import library is based on *exe_name*).
      Alternatively, when set to a string, that gives the base name for
      the import library.  The import library is used when the returned
      build target object appears in `link_with:` elsewhere.  Only has any
      effect on platforms where that is meaningful (e.g. Windows). Implies
      the `export_dynamic` argument.

  pie:

    description: Build a position-independent executable.

  vs_module_defs:
    type: str | file | custom_tgt | custom_idx
    since: 1.3.0
    description: |
      Specify a Microsoft module definition file for controlling symbol exports,
      etc., on platforms where that is possible (e.g. Windows).

      This can be used to expose which functions a shared_module loaded by an
      executable will be allowed to use.
