  This function creates a new top-level target. Like all top-level
  targets, this integrates with the selected backend. For instance, with
  you can run it as `meson compile target_name`. This is a dummy target
  that does not execute any command, but ensures that all dependencies
  are built. Dependencies can be any build target. Since 0.60.0, this includes
  [[@run_tgt]].

  *Since 1.6.0* passing a [[@both_libs]] object builds both shared and
  static libraries.
