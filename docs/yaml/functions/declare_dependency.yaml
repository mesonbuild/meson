name: declare_dependency
returns: dep
description: |
  This function returns a [[@dep]] object that
  behaves like the return value of [[dependency]] but is
  internal to the current build. One use case for this is in
  subprojects. This allows a subproject to easily specify how it should
  be used. This makes it interchangeable with the same dependency that
  is provided externally by the system. Another common use case is to
  declare project targets as dependencies so they may be used as
  dependencies of other build targets.
