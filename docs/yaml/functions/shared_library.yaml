kwargs:
  version:
    type: str
    description: |
      A string specifying the version of this shared library,
      such as `1.1.0`. On Linux and OS X, this is used to set the shared
      library version in the filename, such as `libfoo.so.1.1.0` and
      `libfoo.1.1.0.dylib`. If this is not specified, `soversion` is used
      instead (see above).

  soversion:
    type: str | int
    description: |
      A string or integer specifying the soversion of this shared library,
      such as `0`. On Linux and Windows this is used to set the
      soversion (or equivalent) in the filename. For example, if
      `soversion` is `4`, a Windows DLL will be called `foo-4.dll` and one
      of the aliases of the Linux shared library would be
      `libfoo.so.4`. If this is not specified, the first part of `version`
      is used instead (see below). For example, if `version` is `3.6.0` and
      `soversion` is not defined, it is set to `3`.

  darwin_versions:
    type: str | int | array[str]
    since: 0.48.0
    description: |
      Defines the `compatibility version` and `current version` for the dylib on macOS.
      If an array is specified, it must be
      either zero, one, or two elements. If only one element is specified
      or if it's not an array the specified value will be used for setting
      both compatibility version and current version. If unspecified, the
      `soversion` will be used as per the aforementioned rules.

  vs_module_defs:
    type: str | file | custom_tgt | custom_idx
    description: |
      Specify a Microsoft module definition file for controlling symbol exports,
      etc., on platforms where that is possible (e.g. Windows).

      *(Since 1.3.0)* [[@custom_idx]] are supported

  rust_abi:
    type: str
    since: 1.3.0
    description: |
      Set the specific ABI to compile (when compiling rust).
      - 'rust' (default): Create a "dylib" crate.
      - 'c': Create a "cdylib" crate.

  shortname:
    type: str
    since: 1.10.0
    description: |
      A string specifying a DLL name fitting to 8.3 limit on OS/2 of this shared library.
