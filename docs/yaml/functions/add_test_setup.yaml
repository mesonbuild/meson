name: add_test_setup
returns: void
description: |
  Add a custom test setup. This setup can be used to run the tests with a
  custom setup, for example under Valgrind.

  To use the test setup, run `meson test --setup=*name*` inside the
  build dir.

  Note that all these options are also available while running the
  `meson test` script for running tests instead of `ninja test` or
  `msbuild RUN_TESTS.vcxproj`, etc depending on the backend.

posargs:
  name:
    type: str
    description: The name of the test setup

kwargs:
  env:
    type: env | array[str] | dict[str]
    description: |
      environment variables to set
      , such as `['NAME1=value1', 'NAME2=value2']`,
      or an [[@env]] object which allows more sophisticated
      environment juggling. *(Since 0.52.0)* A dictionary is also accepted.

  exe_wrapper:
    type: array[str | external_program]
    description: The command or script followed by the arguments to it

  gdb:
    type: bool
    default: false
    description: If `true`, the tests are also run under `gdb`

  timeout_multiplier:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      A number to multiply the test timeout with.
      *Since 0.57* if timeout_multiplier is `<= 0` the test has infinite duration,
      in previous versions of Meson the test would fail with a timeout immediately.

  is_default:
    type: bool
    since: 0.49.0
    default: false
    description: |
      Set whether this is the default test setup.
      If `true`, the setup will be used whenever `meson test` is run
      without the `--setup` option.

  exclude_suites:
    type: array[str]
    since: 0.57.0
    description:
      An array of test suites that should be excluded when using this setup.
      Suites specified in the `--suite` option
      to `meson test` will always run, overriding `add_test_setup` if necessary.
